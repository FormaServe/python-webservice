# FormaServe Training - Python Examples

<img src="/static/images/Logo.png" align="right">

This repository showcases FormaServeâ€™s training capabilities and provides a simple web-service application.

This project is a Flask web service application that interfaces with the Chinook SQLite database. It provides endpoints to retrieve information about tracks and employees from the database and includes custom error handling for pages not found.

This will run on the IFS of the IBM i.  Requires python and sqlite open-source packages installed.

It requires a copy of the SQLite sample database chinook which can be found in the data directory.  If you require a fresh copy of the SQLite sample database it can be found [here]([http://sqlite](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/))

## Virtual Environment

As with all python projects, it is recommended to run this application in a virtual environment.  Follow the instructions below to get started.

### Create the Virtual Environment

Use the venv module to create a virtual environment inside the project folder. Run the following command:

```bash
# Run the Python command to create a virtual environment in the current directory
python -m venv --system-site-packages .venv
```

Replace .venv with your preferred name for the virtual environment.

### Activate the Virtual Environment

To activate the virtual environment.

#### On IBM i

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate

```

### Deactivate the Virtual Environment

When youâ€™re done working in the virtual environment, deactivate it:

```bash
deactivate

```

**Remember to activate it whenever you work on your project. ðŸ˜Š**

## Error Handling

The application includes custom error handling for 404 Not Found errors.

### Custom 404 Error Page
